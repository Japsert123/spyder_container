# A container for the Spyder IDE!
This container includes the Spyder IDE installed in a conda container together with some often used conda/python packages. 

The container is intended for use in distrobox/toolbox, but can of course be used to your own liking!❤️

Use this container by running:
```
$ distrobox-assemble create --file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Japsert123/spyder_container/refs/heads/master/spyder_container.ini
```
on your local Linux system
